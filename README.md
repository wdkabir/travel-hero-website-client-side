### About Project 
   - This is a tour package booking system website. We take all the responsibilities of our tourists and take order from this site. It's a task of assignment 11 given by programming hero. I've used my own idea to generate this UI as well as functionalities.


#### What I Used Here: 
- I've used react to develop the UI of this site
- I used react font-awesome for icons, Google font. And also used react bootstrap for responsiveness and faster design.
- I placed all the data in Mongdb and load from there.
- Context api was used to get data easily from all the route
- Used Private Route, Google-SignIn for Authentication
- I've created my own backend as well as some api's to connect my client side to the database
